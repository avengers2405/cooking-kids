create backend and fronted

npm init -y //adds package.json
add "type": "module" to file (line 5)

add express packagse using 
npm i express nodemon
(nodemon) to reastart server

edit scripts in package.json 
delete test, add 
"start": "node index.js" // starts node.js, defualt starts with it, so we need to only write npm start, npm run start would do the same, it always exists even when we do not declare it, overrides others when it starts
"dev": "nodemon index.js" //run with nodemon, not default, so we need to specify to run it, so we can only write npm run dev, and npm dev would give error 

npm run dev to start server!!!!! shit gets real fr;

add mongoDBURL to config.js and replace url with appropariate passwords and db name
to run mongodb, execute:
npm i mongoose

then import it to file index.js and use it.

routing means the get/post/put/delete/etc methods + the urls which
respond to different incoming requests, i.e to api endpoints. they 'route'
these diff requests to diff urls and of diff methods appropriately.

api endpoints are those which recieve the reuqests to be processed by
backend

thus to create routes for diff requests, the way they are processed
etc, we create a seperate folder of routes and create routes there,
importing those routes as and when needed

install cors to handle cors for our backend
npm i cors

## NOW FRONTEND
//we will create using vite
npm create vite@latest
//frontend project name, react framework,
//js variant
//then move to frontend and update anything pending
npm i
//this updates everything

// follow instrcutions from tailwind website
npm i react-router-dom

// install react-router-dom to load SPA, unavaliable by defualt
// change some main.jsx
// use BRowserRouter instead of some react direct shit
// use routes and route to handle diff requests
// create pages for diff actions (folder)
